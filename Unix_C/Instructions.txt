To run any program with its corresponding Makefile:

- use the program "Terminal"
- <cd> to go into the correct folder
- <ls> to list the contents and check
- <make> to run the Makefile and compile the program
- <./programName> to execute the program
- <make clean> to remove the program and compiled files when finished

The commands required are as follows:
=============================

cd "folderLocation/subFolder"

ls

make

./programName

make clean

=============================

An example of a Makefile should be located in Question1 of Lab04

Note: A Makefile must always be named "Makefile" with no extensions
