This file is will only be used to be the original document which the program will copy.

To execute the file run "make" in terminal and then input the following information:

./prog <input document> <output document>

So for example we have a text file called read.txt and we want to make a copy of it
called write.txt, we would have to input the following into terminal:
=========================
./prog read.txt write.txt
=========================

To check the program works as intended, use the "diff" command in the terminal to check as follows:
=========================
diff read.txt write.txt
=========================
If no difference between the files exist then the terminal will remain silent.


NOTE: The document that is read must already exist. The new document name is up to the user.
